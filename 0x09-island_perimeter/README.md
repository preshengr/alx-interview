Description of the Task: **0x09. Island Perimeter**

Finding the **perimeter** of an island depicted on a grid map is the problem at hand. A collection of interconnected land cells ({1`s) encircled by water (`0`s) is referred to as an island. You must create a function that uses the following guidelines to determine the island's overall perimeter:

---

#### **Overview of Concepts**:
1. The grid is an integer-based 2D array:
   Water is represented by - {0`.
   - {1` stands for land.

2. Every cell is a square, and the squares' sides are completely joined (either vertically or horizontally).

3. One or more `1`s make up the island, which is completely encircled by `0`s (water).

4. The grid contains a single island. There are no lakes or distinct land masses.
